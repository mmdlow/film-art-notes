---

## A. Introduction

> Like *Chungking Express*, *In The Mood For Love* is concerned with the following three broad and inter-related categories:
> 
> 1. [**Space and Architecture**](#b-space-in-in-the-mood-for-love)
> 2. Time
> 3. Relationships

### A1. Dramatis Personae

| Roles               | Characters                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Main players**    | **Mo Wan** (Mr Chow), **Li Zhen** (Mrs Chan) |
| **Spouses**         | Mrs Chow, Mr Chan                            |
| **Side characters** | Ah Ping, Mrs Suen, Ah Mah, Li Zhen's boss    |

### A2. Interconnectivity of Wong Kar Wai's Films

Films contain references to his other works both past and future

```
E.g.

Hotel room 2046         -> reference to his later film 2046 (2004)
Motif of black coffee   -> similar motif in Chungking Express
Motif of women's shoes  -> similar motif in Chungking Express (The Blonde's heels)
Motif of coincidence    -> similar to first story in Chunking Express
A woman intruding into a man's room
```

More on the [**motif of women's shoes**](#f1-i-womens-shoes).  
More on [**coincidence**](#f1-ii-coincidence).

###### Intrusion

In both *Chungking Express* and *In The Mood For Love*, the scene represents the woman's indulgence in a fantasy

### A3. Elliptical Narrative

> The Film is elliptical in nature, featuring numerous **gaps** and **intermissions in time**

Reasons:
- Film is told from a [**retrospective**](#e1-retrospection) standpoint
- Imperfect memory, gaps in storytelling

Film-making:
- Retrospection suggested by [**opening shot**](#f2-i-photographs)
    ```
    E.g. Camera tracking past photographs -> looking back on the past
    ```
- Elliptical nature suggested by [**clocks**](#f2-ii-clocks)

---

## B. Space in In The Mood For Love

| Type       | Space                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Public     | Apartments, Restuarant |
| Private    | Hotel room             |
| In-between | Alleyway               |

Featured in **empty shots** without people
- Transcendence of the current moment, preservation of the past
    ```
    E.g.

    - Hong Kong 1966 segment ends with longering shot of an empty corridor
    - Film ends with lingering, empty shots of Angkor Wat ruins
    ```

Film shifts between **proximity and distance**
- Close-knit community in the apartments
- The distance between Hong Kong and Singapore 

### B1. Apartments

> Claustrophobic, cramped spaces that **stifle and restrain Mo Wan and Li Zhen**

- Lack of privacy
- Constant sense of being watched and surveillance
    ```
    E.g. The Ah Mah know's everybody's schedules
    ```

- Reflect **stifling social context**
- See [**Walls and Corridors motif**](#f1-iv-walls-and-corridors)

### B2. Restaurant

- Ambiguity starting to creep in
- **Role-playing** begins taking place
- Still a public space - things can only go so far

### B3. Hotel Room

> **Supposedly** the most private and free space, the most intimate physical and emotional engagement takes place here

- However, **fiction-making** takes place here
- Thus, the relationship they create here is also a **fiction/fantasy**

### B4. Alleyway

Features the use of the [**Pathetic Fallacy**](#f2-iv-pathetic-fallacy-through-mise-en-scene).

2 possible interpretations:

#### B4-i. A space revealing one's true nature

- Here, they flirt with and express more of their **truer** and **more transgressive desires**.
- More glimpses of their truer feelings
  - Though the alleyway is ultimately still a **space of enclosure** (not a liberating space)

#### B4-ii. A space for role-play

- All 3 alleyway scenes feature role-play
- It is in their role-playing where they can expresses their truer (transgressive) feelings
  - (**Interpretation**): They act out their adulterous feelings through the role-playing of their spouses

### B5. Angkor Wat

- Monuments and ruins
- Related to theme of **time**, **transcendence** and **preservation** (similar to  the can motif in *Chungking Express*)
    ```
    E.g. Mo Wan whispers his story into the hole in the wall, in order to preserve it
    ```
- See [**Walls and Corridors motif**](#f1-iv-walls-and-corridors)

---

## C. Relationships in In The Mood For Love

On social decorum, restraint and repression.

> Mo Wan and Li Zhen’s relationship is characterized by the **restraint and repression of their desires**

### C1. Restriction by Social Context

> One cause is restriction and regulation by the **external social context**

```
E.g. Li Zhen is reprimanded by Mrs Suen
```

- Society represented by the close-knit community of Mrs Suen and Mr Koo
  - Warm, intimate, yet stifling community
  - Filled with gossip
- The characters have to obey social rules, and adhere to **social decorum, propriety and etiquette**
- Reinforced by use of [**costume**](#f2-iii-costumes)
- Reinforced by use of [**slow camera movement**](#f3-i-camera-movement)

### C2. Self-restriction

> More significantly, beyond social rules and decorum, **Mo Wan and Li Zhen themselves restrain and restrict themselves**

- They find it hard to admit their feelings for each other
- Their conversations are **proper and refined**
  - Only express interest in each other indirectly
    ```
    E.g.

    - Li Zhen makes sesame syrup for Mo Wan
    - Mo Wan invites Li Zhen to help him write his martial arts novels
    ```
- Their interactions are indirect, with a **sense of restraint and denial**

```
"We know it's not true, so why worry" - Li Zhen
```

- Even at this late stage, she is **in denial**
- Yet she breaks down when they rehearse their separation
  - In the role-play, she is free to express her sadness

Indirectness reinforced by the [**elliptical narrative**](#a3-elliptical-narrative)
- One needs to read the small signs and clues to figure out the actual situation
- Results in **ambiguity and possibility** - [***Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps***](#f1-v-perhaps-perhaps-perhaps)

Self-restraint characterized by the [**Waltz motif**](#f1-iv-the-waltz)

### C3. Lack of Closure

> Their desire remains unconsummated and does not reach a closure. Paradoxically, to fulfill this desire is to bring it to an end.
>
> Open-ended and unresolved relationship becomes **transcendent**.

```
E.g. When Mo Wan whispers his secret relationship into the hole in the Angkor Wat temple
```

By leaving the relationship unfulfilled will allow it to remain in the realm of the **imaginary**, where it can **continue into eternity**

### C4. Side Characters

#### C4-i. The Cheating Spouses

- The spouses are a contrast to Mo Wan and Li Zhen
  - Less restrained and refined, more brash and heedless
    ```
    E.g.

    - Mrs Chow is more modern, heedless of social decorum
    - Mrs Chow wears a western dress, has western hairdo, like spicy food (mustard)
    - Mr Chan slurps soup loudly
    ```

    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/mrs-chow-itmfl.png)

- Mo Wan and Li Zhen are more suited to each other, similarly for the spouses

#### C4-ii. Ah Ping

- Character foil to Mo Wan and Li Zhen's restraint
- He acts out his desires by going to brothels

### C5. Use of film-making

> Even as Mo Wan and Li Zhen’s feelings are repressed, they are intensely felt and are **displaced onto the [mise-en-scene](#f2-v-colors)**

---

## D. Role-playing in In The Mood For Love

The act of role-play begins as a means for Mo Wan and Li Zhen to discover how the affair started.

### D1. Blurring of Identities

> It becomes unclear who they are acting as during the role-play: their spouses, or themselves.

```
E.g. When Mo Wan attempts to touch Li Zhen's hand -> role-play bleeding into reality
```

### D2. Discovery of Desire

> It is only through role-playing that they begin to discover/realize their desire for each other.

- Role-playing provides an **imaginary realm** in which they can express and act out their adulterous feelings for each other
- In the film, there is not only physical space but **imaginary space**

### D3. Role-play and Denial

> Later on, they use their role-playing as their spouses to avoid facing their own feelings directly.

- (**Interpretation**): They conduct their adultery through their adulterous spouses
- (**Interpretation**): Their relationship existed largely in the realm of role-playing
  - Use of role-play to explore not only their spouses, but themselves as well

## E. Time in In The Mood For Love

### E1. Retrospection

> The film implies an act of retrospection—looking back in time, a flashback.

- Memory is flawed, film containes gaps and visual obstructions
- Nevertheless, some items are vividly remembered

```
E.g. Wisp of cigarette smoke
```

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/smoke-itmfl.png)

- Results in tension between **vividness** and **obscurity** of recall

### E2. Changes wrought by time

- *In The Mood For Love* is a film that makes us **aware of time**
- Clearest at the end in the shifts from 1962 to 1963 to 1966

##### Broad strokes

```
E.g.

- Rapid changes in Mrws Suen's close-knit community
- "That era has passed. Nothing belonging to it exists anymore" - intertitle
```

##### Subtle, creeping changes

- In the changes in Mo Wan and Li Zhen's relationship

### E3. Transcendence and Angkor Wat

- Angkor Wat: **allusion to a bygone era**
- Viewer invited to construct parallels between the ruins of Angkor Wat and the story of Mo Wan and Li Zhen in Hong Kong
  - Hallways and corridors
  - Storied walls
  - Architecture remaining after all characters have ceased to exist
  - Unspoken relationships remembered by the walls and ruins

- **Metaphor for history**
  - Makes one think of the larger question of history and the past
  - History presetns public records of events, but what of unspoken stories not recorded?

> The luminous, radiant Hong Kong life we have seen will one day - or has it already - disintegrate into ruins similar to the Angkor Wat.
> 
> The stone and rocks suggest both **timeless preservation** and **eventual decay**.

---

## F. Film-making in In The Mood For Love

### F1. Motifs

#### F1-i. Women's shoes

- Focus on Li Zhen's pink slippers and Mrs Chow's heels

```
E.g. Li Zhen wears Mrs Chow's heels as she leaves Mo Wan's room
```
  - Li Zhen begins to take the place of Mrs Chow
  - Note that she kicks off the heels in pain, suggests discomfort with being in the role

```
E.g. Later in the Singapore scene, Li Zhen takes back her slippers
```
  - An **indirect message** about her final attitude/decision on the relationship

#### F1-ii. Coincidence

```
E.g.

- Both move into the apartment on the same day
- Their spouses have an affair with one another
```

#### F1-iii. Black Coffee

```
E.g. Li Zhen making coffee for her boss -> undercurrent of sadness

Similar to Chungking Express where 633 broods on his ex
```

#### F1-iv. Walls and Corridors

> Richly textured with the memories of their inhabitants

#### F1-iv. The Waltz

- "Yumeji's Theme" (*Shigeru Umebayashi*): a waltz that plays repeatedly during the film
- Represents a "to-ing" and "fro-ing" in Mo Wan and Li Zhen's relationship and self-restraint

```
E.g.

- Mo Wan calls Li Zhen, Li Zhen calls Mo Wan (in Singapore)
- Li Zhen's phantom visit to Singapore
- Li Zhen doesn't pick up Mo Wan's call, then rushes to the hotel room after he has left
- Mo Wan visits the apartment in 1966, suspects the woman next door could be Li Zhen, but doesn't knock
```

The relationship:
- Is drawn out over time 
- Never reaches a state of consummation or resolution

#### F1-v. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

- "Quizas, Quizas, Quizas" (*Nat King Cole*)
- Opens questions about the result of Mo Wan and Li Zhen's relationship
  - Was it consummated?
  - Whose child is the little boy's?
- Also reflects Waltz Motif

### F2. Mise-en-scene

> The film's use of mise-en-scene helps to convey the elliptical nature of the narrative.

#### F2-i. Photographs

```
E.g. Camera tracking past photographs -> looking back on the past
```

#### F2-ii. Clocks

Clocks have no second hand
- Suggests that **time passes invisibly, subtly and delicately**

```
"Feelings can creep up just like that" - Mo Wan
```

#### F2-iii. Costumes

- Li Zhen spends most of the film in gorgeous, decorative cheongsams
  - High collar: suggests restriction and **social conformity**
  - Wearing a cheongsam requires an upright posture and manner
  - Vibrant colors belie repressed feelings
- In the bathroom scene, she is undressed and crying
  - Suggests when outside social context in a private space, **we finally see the true self**

#### F2-iv. Pathetic Fallacy through Mise-en-scene

> **Pathetic Fallacy**: Where nature or objects reflect the inner feelings of the humans

```
E.g. The slow-mo scene where Mo Wan and Li Zhen go to buy noodles, it rains heavily

- Reflects their inner state of mind
```

#### F2-v. Colors

> The lush, gorgeous colors and designs of the mise-en-scene are hints of inner intense feelings
> 
> Scresms with the intensity of the repressed emotions

```
E.g. Film's credit sequence in red to signify intense feelings
```

### F3. Cinematography

#### F3-i. Camera Movement

> Characterized by **slow, tracking shots**

- Reinforce idea of formal movements that conform to propriety
- Film rarely breaks out of these formal movements
- Exceptions:
  - Jerky, handheld camera movement 
    ```
    E.g. Whip-like camera movement during Mo Wan and Li Zhen's first dinner scene

    - Li Zhen plucks up the courage to ask Mo Wan a more direct question about their spouses
    ```

#### F3-ii. Slow Motion

- Used in conjunction with the slow, formal camera movement
- Reinforces idea of **delicate, elegant, formal movements**
- Suggests conformity to social etiquette and decorum of the community

#### F3-iii. Fast Motion
