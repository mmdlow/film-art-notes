---

## A. Narrative

- 2-part story
- Characters from different stories sometimes cross paths
    ```
    E.g. Quick glimpse of 633 when Qiwu attempts to call May after making an arrest
    ```

- Reflects nature of **encounters in the city**
    ```
    "Everyday we brush past so many other people. People we may never meet or people who may become close friends." - Qiwu
    ```
    - There can be chance encounters that are more significant

- Suggests other potential stories in the city
- Hints at the city as a **place of multiple possibilities**

### A1. Dramatis Personae

| 1st Story      | 2nd Story      |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Cop 233 / Qiwu | Cop 633        |
| May            | Air Stewardess |
| The Blonde     | Faye           |

### A2. First Story: key points

> The first story is about living in the random flux of the city and yet being able to transcend it

- A [moment of random chance](#b4-i-relationships-in-the-first-story) results in a moment of transcendence
- [Arresting a moment of transcendence](#effect-on-qiwu) out of the flux of time

---

## B. Relationships

> Every other detail in the film relates to the relationships of the characters
>
> These details:
> - Give **information** about the characters
> - Give **insight** about the characters
> - **Invite us to interpret** their relationships
>
> Characterized by **non-relationships** that grow to become meaningful
> - [First story](#non-relationship-in-the-first-story)
> - [Second story](#non-relationship-in-the-second-story)

### B2. Relationships in the city

> Random, chance encounters that are **fleeting** and **empty of meaning**, Brownian motion

- "**Proximity without Reciprocity**" (*Ackbar Abbas*)
- Physically close but emotionally distant, no meaningful reciprocal interaction

### B3. Relationships embedded in time

- Relationships may have an expiry date
- Relational opportunities exist within time
  - E.g. to miss a moment or to be just in time 
- Different relationships may experience time differently

#### B3-i. Songs to reflect time and relationships

See [**Sound**](#e4-sound)

### B4. Relationships in the two stories

> *Chungking Express* represents two different relationships that, in their own different ways, are **successful in overcoming the random flux of the city and time to form significant connections**

#### B4-i. Relationships in the First story

Focus on Qiwu and The Blonde's relationship

- Transcends the random flux of the city
- Relationship centered on **coincidences**
    ```
    E.g.

    - Accidental bumping into each other at the beginning
    - Coincidental meeting in the bar
    - Happy birthday greeting
    ```

##### Non-relationship in the First story

- "Relationship" is virtually a "non-relationship"
    - Brief encounter in bar followed by stretch of empty time in the hotel room
    - Lack of proper conversation
    - Minimal reciprocity

> Despite their relationship being a reflection of — indeed, a function of — the random flux of the city, they are able to generate between them a **very deep connection**, and **a moment of lasting significance and transcendence**.

##### Effect on Qiwu

- Deep connection occurs when The Blonde's message reaches Qiwu at the exact time of his birth
  - Qiwu is touched, experiences **deep emotional moment of permanence** he will remember forever
  - **Random chance** paradoxically results in **deep significance and transcendence**

- Use of [**Freeze Frame**](#frozen-shot-of-qiwu) to preserve special moment
  - Finding moment of significance in the flux of time
  - Associated with [**Canning motif**](#e5-iii-canned-pineapples)
  - Metaphorical "canning" of time
  - Qiwu experiences an epiphany, is able to carry on
    ```
    "Is there anything in the world that doesn’t expire?"

    "If memories could be canned would they also have expiry dates? If so, I hope they last for centuries."

    - Qiwu
    ```

##### Effect on The Blonde

- Parallel with Qiwu: she is able to move on beyond her former relationship with the Caucasian man
  - She sheds her wig and false identity
  - True identity is barely glimpsed, or just missed
  - [**Freeze Frame**](#frozen-shot-of-the-blonde) also used to preserve this moment

#### B4-ii. Relationships in the Second story

Focus on Cop 633 and Faye's relationship

- Succeeds in overcoming the changes wrought by the passage of time
- Encounters structured by **predictable routine** rather than coincidence
  - Contrasts when Faye breaks into 633's apartment: a break in routine

##### Non-relationship in the Second story

- Parallel to First story: relationship is fairly insubstantial
- Characterized by daydreams, being out of touch with reality.
- More imagined then real: [California Dreaming](#e4-sound)

1. 633
    - Living in the past

2. Faye
    - Interest in 633 characterized by daydreaming and **being out of touch with reality**
    - When asked out by 633, suddenly confronted with reality

##### Overcoming the non-relationship

After Faye leaves, relationship is held together only by the thinnest of threads: the **Boarding Pass**
  - Imaginary pass
  - Scribbled on napkin
  - Barely legible future date
  - Puts the **open-endedness of time** between them

Relationship is still maintained one year later
  - Faye returns on the actual date of the boarding pass, 1 year later
  - 633 has kept the boarding pass

Change in identities
  - Reversal of roles (breaking of 180-degree rule)
  - Changes have possibly made them more compatible with one another
  - Even more ready to embark on a relationship after the changes of 1 year
  - But still an open-ended relationship in process

1. 633
    - Behind the counter
    - Now likes California Dreaming

2. Faye
    - Now in uniform, an air stewardess

3. Midnight Express
    - Played major role in film, now also undergoing renovation

### B5. Film-making and Relationships

See [**Food Motif**](#e5-motifs)

---

## C. Time in Chungking Express

> Time is an omnipresent entity but it is also **abstract and metaphysical**

- Despite abstractness of time, Wong makes the viewer conscious of time
    ```
    E.g. Crosscutting to the clock
    ...on 28 April, 1994 at 9pm, Qiwu bumps into The Blonde -> cut to clock
    ```

### C1. Time as a flux

- **Relentless, high-speed, undifferentiated flux**
- Reflects experience in fast-paced city
- Represented by [**fast motion**](#e2-iii-different-rates-of-motion)

### C2. Time as a moment

- Idea of **arresting or capturing a moment** within the relentless flux of time
  - Very human desire
  - Arrest moment of permanence within the ephemeral, high-speed flux of time
- Represented by [**freeze frame**](#e2-i-freeze-frame)
- Wong plays with different aspects of **"The Moment"**
  - Just in time
  - Events just missed by a moment
    ```
    E.g. In The Mood For Love
    
    "It is a restless moment.  She has kept her head lowered to give him a chance to come closer.  But he would not for lack of courage.  She turns and walks away." - Intertitle
    ```

### C3. Passage of Time

Wong is also concerned with the passage of time, and the **changes wrought** by the passage of time

- Applies to second story
- Passing of time shown through changes in the [**mise-en-scene**](#e1-mise-en-scene)

### C4. Time in the two stories

- Different concepts of time in both stories
- Reinforced by **Narrative Parallels**
    ```
    Examples:
    
    - Dumped by 2 women
    - Qiwu dumps his pager; 633 throws away the letter from Faye
    - Receiving messages from various women
    ```

Shown through use of [**Parallel mise-en-scene**](#e1-ii-parallel-mise-en-sccene)

#### C4-i. Time in the First story

- Fast
- Precisely-defined
  - Qiwu's precise time keeping
    ```
    "57 hours later, I would fall in love with this woman" (he meets The Blonde 57 hours later)
    ```
  - Moment of transition from day to day: [intercut scenes of clock](#c-time-in-chungking-express)

##### Hotel room scene

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/hotel-room-cke.jpg)

- Qiwu trying to kill time by eating and watching old movies while the blonde sleeps
- Sense of empty time, trying to fill it but can’t

#### C4-ii. Time in the Second story

- Gradual
- A flow and a continuum
  - No clear boundary that marks precise points in time
  - Open-ended flow
  - Relationship as an open-process without precise boundaries

##### Boarding pass scene

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/633-boarding-pass-cke.png)

- **Rain**: blurring and movement conveys sense of time
- **Spinning toaster**: gradual, perpetual motion

##### Fish tank scene

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/fishtank-cke.jpg)

- Shot through fish tank
- Dreamy feel to the scene
- Fish tank, water and bubbles gives an alternative sense of dreamtime/dream space

## D. The City: Urban Space in Chungking Express

> In *Chungking Express*, space is not homogeneous and uniformly the same. Instead, it is:
> 1. **Heterogeneous**
> 2. **Differentiated into various dimensions**
> 3. Made up of **multiple, different elements**
>     - Cultural
>     - Psychological

### D1. Urban Space as a Heterogeneous Space

> Differentiated into non-homogenous zones or spaces

#### Different physical zones

E.g. 633's apartment

#### Different psychological zones

"The city is a 'space of desire'... not only a physical space, but also a psychic one" (*Ackbar Abbas*)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/urban-space-1-cke.png)

1. Faye buying the bear
    - Whimsical, positive mood

2. The Blonde standing outside
    - Moody, contemplative

### D2. Hong Kong as a Multicultural Space

See [**Mise-en-scene juxstaposition**](#e1-iii-juxstaposition)

Also:

- Midnight Express — an American fast-food joint or an Asian adaptation?
- American pop music or Indian adaptations of this cultural form?

### D3. Use of Cinematography

See [**Selective focus**](#e2-ii-selectiveracking-focus), [**Different rates of motion**](#e2-iii-different-rates-of-motion)

---

## E. Film-making in Chungking Express

### E1. Mise-en-scene

#### E1-i. Costume changes

In some scenes, we become aware that time has passed only through changes in the **mise-en-scene**, especially **costumes**.
```
E.g. After one year, 633 and Faye have changed

- Faye in stewardess uniform
- 633 no longer in uniform, wearing the shirt Faye gave him
```

#### E1-ii. Parallel Mise-en-sccene

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/qiwu-msg-cke.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/633-boarding-pass-cke.png)

- Paralleled by rectangular block on the left
- Pager vs Handwritten letter

#### E1-iii. Juxstaposition

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/ck-mansions-cke.png)

- Chungking Mansion complex as a multicultural space
- The use of mise-en-scene to suggest how the space is made up of many different cultural elements
    - Chinese altar juxstaposed with television set
    - Highlights heterogeneous space, never homogenous

### E2. Cinematography

#### E2-i. Freeze frame

###### Frozen shot of Qiwu

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/qiwu-msg-cke.png)

###### Frozen shot of The Blonde

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/blonde-cke.png)

We miss The Blonde's identity by just a moment

#### E2-ii. Selective/Racking Focus

> When the focus changes mid-shot
> 
> Wong uses selective focus to segment urban space into differentiated zones

```
E.g. Shot where 633 and Faye are face-to-face

633 shares what he likes (Chef's salad) -> superficiality of city life
```

- Highlights basic condition of urban experience, proximity without reciprocity
- Contrasts with deep focus in *Citizen Kane* to show relational gulf

#### E2-iii. Different Rates of Motion

> Wong uses different rates of motion, including **fast motion**, to segment urban space into different **psychological** zones

```
E.g. Shot where 633 drinks coffee as he thinks about his ex-girlfriend
```

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/633-coffee-cke.PNG)

- Segmented into different psychological zones
    1. 633's melancholic brooding (past)
    2. Faye's growing infatuation (future)
    3. Indifferent passing crowds (present)

#### E2-iv. Others

- Stretch printing
- Mobile framing (camera movement, handheld camera)

### E3. Editing

- Dynamic (e.g. drug smuggling scene)
- Disjunctive and discontinuous
- Crosscuts
  > Editing that cuts between two or more actions occurring in different places, usually simultaneously
  - E.g. [Clock](#c-time-in-chungking-express)

### E4. Sound

Used to **reflect time and relationships**

1. Things in Life - *Dennis Brown*
    ```
    "It’s not everyday that things are gonna be the same way. There must be a change somehow."
    ```
2. What a difference a day makes - *Dinah Washington*
3. California Dreaming - *The Mamas and the Papas*
    - Represents Faye's dreamy, out-of-touch-with-reality state of mind

### E5. Motifs

Major motif of **Food**

#### E5-i. Chef's salad

```
633 buys chefs salad for his air stewardess girlfriend
```
- As 633 changes his food orders, we can discern how his girlfriend responds to his food choices
- His girlfriend also comes to conclude that she can "try other men" like she tries new food
- Helps us **interpret his relationship with his girlfriend**

##### Subtler points

- 633 does not understand his girlfriend, thus she leaves
- 633 is a **creature of habit**
  - Not suited to the stewardess
  - Stewardess ends up with a biker, a **more adventurous type** (?)

#### E5-ii. Black Coffee

```
After his girlfriend leaves him, 633 drinks black coffee everyday
```

- Gives us insight into 633's state of mind after the breakup

#### E5-iii. Canned pineapples

```
May likes eating pineapples
```

- Qiwu's obsession with canned pineapples: trying to **preserve memories of girlfriend**
- Cans are **ambivalent motif**: suggest [**preservation and expiry**](#b3-relationships-embedded-in-time)
