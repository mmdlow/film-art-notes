## A. Introduction

### A1. Stanley Kubrick

> Films portray a “disenchanted, sardonic and generally pessimistic view of humanity”
>
> An **auteur**: distinctive cinematic style, viewer finds certain themes, ideas, motifs recurring throughout his films

See [**Contorted Face motif**](#e1-i-contorted-face), [**Geometric Shape motif**](#e1-ii-geometric-shapes)

---

## B. The Film

4-part narrative:
1. Dawn of Man
2. Untitled second section
3. Jupiter Mission: 18 months later
4. Jupiter and beyond the infinite
    - Gesturing how we’re going even beyond the limits of human subjective perception

> Features a pattern of **spatial expansion**

- Prehistoric Era
  - Stable spatial coordinates

- Jupiter Mission
  - No spatial coordinates
  - No sense of up/down/left/right

- Beyond Infinite
  - 3D space no longer exists

### B1. Dawn of Man

#### B1-i. Conflict in Dawn of Man

- Shows primordial traits of Man:
  - Savagery, aggressopm, murdeerousness, will to dominate
- Foreshadows different form of conflict in l[**ater sections**](#the-cold-war)

#### B1-ii. Film-making in Dawn of Man

##### Opening scenes

- Still shots of empty land but we hear insects so we know life is present
- First moving shot is a **tilt up**, represents **broadening of horizons**, looking to and beyond the horizons
- **Skeleton on the ground**: Sense of time, parallels this shot in *Beyond the Infinite*:

##### Discovery of tools

- Discovery of [**The Bone**](#c1-i-the-bone)
- Low camera angle
- Rhythmic editing during the crushing of the skull
  - Point of change in figure behaviour
  - Ape begins to stand upright, more vertical

### B2. Untitled Second Section

#### B2-i. Summary

- **Dr Heywood Floyd** travels to the moon, makes a transit stop at The Wheel
  - Moon has almost become like a tourist object
  - Man has lost its sense of awe

- Lack of straightforward linear orientation in space
  - Similarly, the distinctive “linear narrative” we expect is dispersed and loses its strong momentum

#### B2-ii. Conflict in the Second Section

```
E.g. We see weapons out of control: 

- Drifting satellites
- The pen is drifting -> possible metaphor for the Cold War spinning out of control
- Man is asleep
```

- Man has lost control of his technological creations
- Machines now in control (?)

##### The Cold War

> *2001* imagines that the Cold War continues into the 21st century, and thus:  
> The pursuit of technology is **the pursuit of self-destruction**

Features the use of [**parallel mise-en-scene**](#e3-i-parallel-mise-en-scene)

### B3. Jupiter Mission: 18 Months Later

#### B3-i. Summary

```
"18 months ago, the first evidence of intelligent life off the earth was discovered... Except for a single, very powerful radio emission, aimed at Jupiter, the 4 million year old black monolith had remained inert, its origin and purpose still a total mystery" 

- Pre-recorded message
```

- Continues situation of depersonalization 
- Dave and Frank: cold and impersonal (dehumanized men)
- HAL: ironically, more personal (humanized machine)
- Dramatic one-on-one showdown between **dehumanized man** and **humanized machine**

Outcome:
- Bowman recovers his instincts, humanity
```
E.g. He re-enters the Discovery without his helmet -> sheds his dependence on technology
```

### B4. Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite

#### B4-i. Summary

- Bowman travels into Jupiter space and beyond
- Film from this point onwards leaves aside all conventional themes
- A trace of the human being still exists:  **the “eye”**
- Concludes in a room: familiar and unfamiliar aspects
  - Is he in a cage? a human zoo?

#### B4-ii. The Stargate

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/stargate-2001.png)

While it looks chaotic to us, there may be an order to it that we can't perceive

#### B4-iii. The Room

- Rectilinear room is highly ironic
  - No longer in 3-D time or space
  - Don't expect a conventional 3D space in a non-3D spacetime
  - Is it a “normal” physical room, or matter in some other form, or Bowman’s “subjective hallucination”

- Room is in the 18th-century style. The 18th-century, in Western history, is a **time of enlightenment**

#### B4-iv. The Star Child

- Bowman evolves into the Star Child
- Usual dimensions don’t apply
- Now a new being: He can be both a baby and a cosmic body

## C. Themes in *2001*

### C1. Human Advancement

> Is Man experiencing progress or regress?
> 
> Does technological advancement help to advance Man? Or is technological advancement more ambiguous?

#### C1-i. The Bone

- The first tool **or** weapon
  - Ambiguity in this sign of technological progress
    ```
    E.g. Shot of the bone spinning in the air, transitions to satellite

    - Satellite possibly an orbital weapon
    - Shows escalation of the use of technology for violence -> "The Dusk of Man"
    ```

Bones are:
1. Associated with **death**
    - Technology associated with **dehumanization**
    - As man progresses, he becomes more cold and dehumanized, **spiritual death**

2. An **extension** of Man
    - Thus, technology is an extension/mirror of Man
    - Technology is as flawed as Man is

#### C1-ii. Discovery One Spacecraft

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/discovery-one-2001.png)

- Large head
  - Implies advanced brain
- Thin, minimal body
  - Man has advanced in terms of intelligence, but regressed in other areas

### C2. Dehumanization

> Caused by Man's pursuit of technology
> 
> Though man has made tremendous progress in intelligence and technology, his **humanity has diminished**
> The **ambivalence** of Man's progress

- Reinforced by use of [**geometric shapes**](#e1-ii-geometric-shapes)

**Prehistoric period**: Apes live in communities with physical closeness  
**21st century**: Man is separated by vast distances; there is alienation and a loss of relationships and humanity

```
E.g.

- Human beings dwarfed by machines of their own creation
- The hibernating scientists are barely human
- Man, often seen as mechanical and robotic
- Dave Bowman and Frank Poole: efficient but unemotional -> cold and lacking in warm humanity
```

#### C2-i. The Human Characters

Namely, **David Bowman** and **Frank Poole**

- No distinctive character traits — not individualized
- Kubrick’s point — precisely to show that Man has become dehumanized
- Man has become **machinelike**, while ironically machines have become more human
  - **HAL** is more communicative and emotional than Dave and Frank, `"I’m  afraid."`

### C3. The True God and the False God

> "the God concept is at the heart of 2001." - Kubrick

#### C3-i. The Monolith: The True God

Characteristics of a **True God**:
- Transcendent of space, time, and 3 dimensions
- Represents geometric perfection
- Ultimately ungraspable, cannot be contained by Man
- Associated with **order in the universe**

```
E.g. Last scene, Bowman attempts to grasp it -> reference Michaelangelo's God's Creation of Adam
```

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/michaelangelo-2001.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/bowman-old-2001.png)

Reinforced by [**motif of geometry**](#geometry-and-the-monolith).

#### C3-ii. HAL: The False God

##### Man's relationship with technology

Relationship between **creator** and **created**

1. Creation in the Creator's likeness
    - Ideas in Christianity:

    ```
    "Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness"
    - Genesis 1:26
    ```

    - The created machine mirrors his creator, the human
    - This mirroring relationship is suggested by **how machines come from “bones”**
    - Observe how machines often mirror Man in 2001

2. Man begins to worship his creation, the False God
    - Technology does become Godlike, and functions like Man’s God
    - Man is totally reliant on technology in 2001

##### HAL as Godlike

- Infallibility(?) `E.g. "Foolproof and incapable of error"`
- Highest perfection of logic and reason?
- Omniscient and omnipotent(?) (manages all operations onboard)
- Humans are completely reliant on HAL
- Visual image of man bringing a sacrificial offering to HAL

##### HAL as a False God

> HAL, **made in the image of Man**, is only too human and reflects Man’s shortcomings

- HAL mirrors his sinful maker (Man)
  - Ambition, murderousness, cunning, subtle deceit
- Turns murderous, like his creators

##### HAL's Errors

3 possible interpretations:

1. Genuine mistake
    - HAL is fallible after all—a false God after all
    - Here, **HAL’s sin is his pride** — he refuses to admit his mistake
    - He is, like his maker, all too human
    - Retaliates when Dave and Frank threaten to disconnect him

2. Descent into madness
    - HAL, who supposedly embodies perfect rationality, is paradoxically going mad

3. Deliberate mistake
    - To provoke Dave and Frank, **ultimately to destroy them, so that he will be the only one reaching Jupiter**
      - He wants to reach Jupiter space and be the being to undergo further evolution
    - Here, **HAL’s sin is his ambition and murderous intent**
    - HAL rebels against his creator (another christian idea)

- Showdown between Man and machine, creator and created, is visually reduced to pure geometric forms
- Contrast between the tremendous violence in the action and Kubrick’s [**cold, detached, clinical visual representation**](#c1-ii-discovery-one-spacecraft)

---

## E. Film-making in *2001*

### E1. Motifs

- Dual qualities of geometric order and instincts of aggresssion and murderousness, **coexisting together ironically**
- *2001* has a geometric, rational, orderly exterior, but...
- **irrationality and aggression** lurk beneath
- Seen in **HAL**

#### E1-i. Contorted Face

Suggests:
- Mental breakdown
- Man's loss of reason
- **Uncontrolled instincts** of **agression, violence and murderousness** at Man's core

#### E1-ii. Geometric Shapes

##### Intelligence, Design and Order

> There is an intelligence behind the “order” of geometrical forms: circles and squares
> 
> But geometric forms are also **inhuman, impersonal, cold and emotionally empty**, thus underscoring theme of **dehumanization**.

Squares:
- Sense of order
  - Equal sides, symmetrical
- Sense of intelligence
  - If there is order, **some intelligence must have created this order**
  - Animals can't create order

Circles:
- Another form of order, but **exists in nature**
- Suggests that **there is order in nature**
- Asks: is there a creator who created these forms of order in nature

##### Geometry and The Monolith

> Reflects **order and intelligence**

- Represents a kind of order that the contrasting **prehistoric setting** lacks
- Perfect, immaculate form
  - Sign of perfection and transcendence, appearing on Earth
  - Reinforced by music, [**Lux Aeterna**](#e2-i-lux-aeterna)

##### Planetary Alignment

- Metaphor for **human progress**
- Signifies order in the universe instead of chaos
  - Alignment of not 2 but 3 planetary bodies
  - Reinforced by music, [**Thus Spoke Zarathustra**](#e2-ii-thus-spoke-zarathustra)

Is the sun really rising?
- Orientation of alignment and the concept of a "rising sun" is ambiguous
- Questions reality of **human advancement**

### E2. Sound

#### E2-i. Lux Aeterna

- Composed by Gyorgy Ligeti
- Plays when the Monolith appears
- Accompanies **perfect geometric form** that manifests itself
- Could be either diegetic or non-diegetic

#### E2-ii. Thus Spoke Zarathustra

- Composed by Richard Strauss
- Plays during planetary alignment
- Sense of the grandiose

### E3 Mise-en-scene

#### E3-i. Parallel Mise-en-scene

Parallel between territorial dispute between Apes over the water hole, and the meeting on the wheel
```
E.g. the Russian pulls his drink back towards him
```
- Different kind of conflict: **words as weapons now**
- Less explicit hostility
