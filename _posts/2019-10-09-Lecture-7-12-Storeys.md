## A. About the Film

> The viewer is invited to:
> 
> 1. Explore **parallels and contrasts** between different characters
> 2. Engage with Khoo’s **use of silence** in the film
>       - the silence may contain a **complex emotional reality**
> 3. Discern that there are **other stories beyond what is represented**

- *12 Storeys* depicts a few sets of characters within a certain milieu, similar to *Chungking Express*

### A1. Dramatis Personae

| Story # | Characters                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.      | **Meng**, Trixie, Tee, Eddy (and Trixie's other boyfriends) |
| 2.      | **San San**, her deceased foster mother, Rachel             |
| 3.      | **Lili**, **Ah Gu**, Lili's China boyfriend                 |
| 4.      | **Spirit**, Spirit's mother, father                         |

- Different sets of characters do not **interact** with one another, similar to *Chungking Express*
- They do, however, **encounter** one another
    ```
    E.g.

    1. Meng encounters San San in the playground
    2. Meng encounters his Malay neighbor 
    ```

- Similar themes of **relationships in an urban context**
  - Proximity without reciprocity
  - Living in the same block, but no significant interaction


### A2. The Title "12 Storeys"

- A pun: 12 storeys, 12 (or innumerable) stories
- The film opens and closes with shots of HDB blocks
  - Shows other families and characters
  - Suggests there's more to the main 3+ stories we focus on

### A3. Duration

- Set in **one long day**
- Starts with a character in pain (**Spirit**), ends with other characters in pain

---

## B. Themes

### B1. A Critique of Economic Progress

> The film is a criticism of Singapore as having made great progress in terms of economic development but lacking in the area of relationships and emotional development.

**HDB Block**: Icon of Singapore's successful economic development
  - Economic progress at the cost of other priorities, values
  - Shown through **uniformity** of HDB flats

**Playground**: Play and creativity
  - To Ah Gu, represents longing for children
  - To Meng, reminder of happier days past

**Spirit**: also play and creativity
  - Associated objects:
    - Figurines
    - Comics
    - Video camera (self-reflexive reference to Eric Khoo himself)

#### B1-i. About Meng

> Represents overbearing paternalism and hypocrisy

##### Model Citizen

- External image of the model citizen — the character **most fully shaped by the policies of the Singapore government**
  - Hence what happens to him is ironic
  - Repressed sexuality
  - Double life, suggested by [**the mirror**](#the-mirror) (**hypocrisy**)

##### Metaphor for the Government

- **Paternalistic**, like an overbearing father
  - Seeking to regulate the lives of his wards, **without respecting their individuality**
    ```
    "I am what I am" - Trixie
    ```
  - Has provided for his siblings but uses this act to **demand their conformity** and **give up their individuality**
  - Reflects style of the Singapore Government

### B2. Breakdown of Human Relationships in Singapore

> Contrasts with image of successful Singapore propogated by the government and media

```
E.g. Shot of skyline when Spirit commits suicide

- Ironic juxstaposition of economic progress with relationships breaking down
```

#### B2-i. Relationship Breakdowns

1. Parent-child relationships
    - Meng and Trixie
    - Spirit and parents
    - Rachel, her son, her Filipino maid

2. Husband-wife relationships
    - Ah Gu and Lili

3. Community relationships

#### B2-ii. Alienation

> The characters in the film are deeply alienated, have no meaningful connection to others

- Meng is a "model citizen" but deeply lonely and alienated at his core
- Lili is deeply lonely and alienated in a foreign country

```
"Men never know what women want" - Lili
```

#### B2-iii. Characters in Pain

> At its close, 12 Storeys climaxes in a crescendo of pain, and presents successive characters - Meng, Lili, San San - in pain

1. Meng
    - Pain from repressing his own desires, due to his morally-upright image

2. Lily
    - Relational pain

3. San San
    - Silent pain

---

## C. Narrative Techniques

### C1. Character Parallels

> The film constantly invites the viewer to juxtapose and compare the characters

Parallels indicated by:
1. Parallel mise-en-scene
2. Parallel actions

#### C1-i. Parallel Mise-en-scene

See [**Mise-en-scene**](#d1-mise-en-scene)

#### C1-ii. Parallel actions

```
E.g. Trying on a dress
```

#### C1-iii. Lili and San San

- Parallel indicated through editing
- One character's concerns become mirrored in another's
- Both victims of physical appearances - **the plight of women**
- Film ends with **the pain of female existence**
  - Both have relational and sexual needs
  - Both experience displacement (as local and as foreigner)

### C2. Character Juxstaposition

#### C2-i. Meng and San San

- Use of mise-en-scene in playground
- Use of contrasting character actions in playground:
  - Meng: actively exercising
  - San San: sitting in stillness and silence

#### C2-ii. Rachel and Lili

- Implicit comparison, as they never meet
- Lili's experience mirrored in Rachel's
- Rachel as the "Singaporean bride"

### C3. Short Snippets

> The film presents short snippets so that the viewer needs to read the **implied story**

```
E.g.

1. Spirit and his physical pain
2. Rachel and her marriage to an American man
3. Joyce talking to the other homesick maid, who misses her son
    - Passing reference to parent-child separation
    - Resonates with other stories
```

- Fuller story behind snippet is left untold
- Vieewer is invited to imagine untold story behind snippet

### C4. Silence

> The viewer has to read certain characters’ silence, makes for more **ambiguity** and **richness**

```
E.g. San San, Spirit

Their silence contains complex feelings
```

- The film sensitizes us to the many people who struggle in **silent pain** around us
- Silence contains **unexpressed pain**

#### C4-i. Silence vs Speech

> Silence indicates relational and communication breakdown.
>
> However, speech is also used to indicate the breakdown.

```
E.g. Ah Gu and Lili’s relationship is loud and noisy but still it indicates relational breakdown
```

- Multitude of languages used in *12 Storeys*
  - English, broken (Eddy) and proper (Meng)
  - Chinese
    - Mandarin (Lili, Ah Gu)
    - Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew (Ah Gu and Coffee Shop uncles)
  - Malay
  - Tamil
  - Tagalog
  - Silence

#### C4-ii. San San and Spirit

- Wordless drama on the 12th storey
- Silent, yet with turbulent feelings underneath
- Audience can only guess at unarticulated thoughts and feelings

> Without the need for words, Spirit intuitively feels sympathy for San San and senses that she, too, is troubled, thus he follows her out of the lift
>
> Silence as **alienation**, but also **connection through silence** between Spirit and San San
>
> A **redemptive** silence

##### A possible interpretation

- Spirit silently identifies with San San
- Kills himself to return to comfort San San
- An unlikely relationship between a young man and an older women
- **The only redemptive relationship in the film**, conducted entirely in silence

##### Final scene

- Extreme close-up of San San's eye opening as she is embraced by Spirit
  - She senses the embrace of the spirit, a sense of comfort
  - OR: "come with me"

## D. Film-making in 12 Storeys

### D1. Mise-en-scene

Helps convey **character parallels**

##### The Mirror

```
E.g. Meng, San San and Lili all look into the mirror at one point
```

- Represents seeing a different truth about oneself

##### The Television

```
E.g. Meng, San San and Ah Gu are all seen watching TV in isolation
```

### D2. Editing

Khoo frequently departs from continuity editing.

#### D2-i. San San's mother

- San San's routine frequently intercut with close-ups of her mother berating her
- Mother's face dominates frame, a domineering, suffocating, omnipresent figure in San San's life
