blurb: Naturalism & Von Stroheim's Use of Misce-en-Scene
---

## A. Narrative

### A1. Background

- Adapted from Frank Norris’ novel **McTeague: A Story of San Francisco** (1899)
- Butchered masterpiece
  - Original version: over than 9 hrs
  - Director's cut: 5 hrs
  - Stroheim’s friend, Rex Ingram, cut it to 4 hrs
  - Studio’s cut: 2 1/4 hrs (the rest of footage has never been recovered)
  - Recently restored version: 4hrs (newly discovered stills added; contains stills of Mac’s father; Maria and Zerkow subplot etc.)

### A2. Prologue

- Original prologue cut from 2.5 h to 7 min
- Contained important scenes of McTeague’s background, especially his father
- **Mac's father** exemplifies idea of **Man as a degraded, beast-like being**

### A3. Subplot 1

- Degraded relationship between **Maria** and **Zerkow**
  - **Maria**: Cleaning lady who sells lottery ticket to **Trina**
  - **Zerkow**: Her husband
  - Intended to foreshadow how McTeague and Trina’s marriage will end up in destruction

| Maria & Zerkow           | McTeague & Trina                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Both live in a junk shed | **Start**: M&T's bourgeois lifestyle                 |
|                          | **End**: M&T end up living in dilapidated conditions |
|                          | **Foreshadowing**: degradation                       |
| Zerkow kills Maria       | **Foreshadowing**: Mac kills Trina                   |
  
- Surreal shot of hands playing with gilded objects
  - Actually belong to the Maria and Zerkow subplot, re-edited to apply to Trina
  - Part of Zerkow's dreams where he lusts for gilded ojects
  - **Guant/malformed/elongated arms**: degradation in the pursuit of wealth
  - **Bar-like shadows**: cage/prison cell motif => contrast with hands grasping at gold
  - Zerkow/Maria ironically trapped by their own greed
  - Inner person undergoing corruption
  - Spiritual death/deformity in the pursuit of material wealth, even if successful

### A4. Subplot 2

- Shy relationship between Mr Grannis and Miss Baker that blossoms into romance
- A contrast to Mac and Trina’s declining marriage

---

## B. Von Stroheim's Artistic Manifesto

### B1. Emphasis on Realism

- In terms of the authenticity of props and settings
- In terms of seeing reality as it is, and **rejecting a romanticized or idealized reality** (associated with mainstream cinema, even in Stroheim’s time)  

```
"I intended to show men and women . . . with their good and bad qualities, their noble and idealistic sides and their jealous, vicious, mean, greedy sides"
- Von Stroheim
```

- Stroheim’s characters: mixture of good and bad, yet dark side ultimately prevails
- MacTeague may have tender, compassionate, even artistic side, yet darker brutish self triumphs

|              | Good Traits                                                                                 | Bad Traits                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Marcus**   | “Altruistically” gives up Trina to Mac                                                      | Becomes jealous when Trina acquires the fortune                               |
| **McTeague** | Prologue: He is gentle and compassionate towards the bird                                   | Violent and brutish, he attacks the miner who knocks the bird out of his hand |
|              | - Use of extreme closeup as he kisses the bird                                              |                                                                               |
|              | - Large hand in foreground gently handles bird, yet later in the film is used to kill Trina |                                                                               |

### B2. Philosophy of Naturalism

#### B2-i. A positive view of Man

- Being guided by reason and able to make rational choices
- Being free to choose and able to make moral choices
- Being free to determine one’s life trajectory
- Potential for self-realization

#### B2-ii. A negative (NATURALIST) view of Man

```
"a primitive brute governed by his instincts and limited by his heredity and environment" (Finler 23)
```

Stroheim’s film seeks not just to exemplify realism, but **the Philosophy of Naturalism**

1. Philosophical View of Man: What is Man?
2. Philosophy of Naturalism, as exemplified by Greed

- School of thought developed by French and American writers at the end of the 19th century
- Emerged partly out of the influence of Darwin’s evolutionary theory in the 19th-century: man evolves from ape
- Thus associates man closely with nature, specifically animals and biological beings
- Man is animal-like, brutish, and predominantly nothing more than a biological being  
  ```
  E.g. Mac and Marcus clawing and tearing at each other like wild animals in the last scene
  ```

##### Quick Summary of Greed's naturalism

> Presents the view that **Man is an animal-like being controlled and determined by [1] [Instinct](#1-governed-by-instinct), [2] [Heredity](#2-governed-by-heredity) and [3] [Environment](#3-limited-by-environment)**
>
> The film’s naturalism results in an overall general sense of how there are **[4] [constantly larger forces or a larger fate](#4-larger-forces) that **controls, dooms and destroys the characters**.
>
> There is an overall recurring sense of **entrapment and doom**.

##### [1] Governed by Instinct

- Characters as biological beings strongly controlled by instincts that are destructive of others and themselves
- Not just emotions but **compulsive instincts**
- **Mac**
  - **[+]** Compassionate and kind at times **[-]** but a larger brutish violence lurks within him.
  - **[+]** May rise to become a civilized middle-class dentist **[-]** but brutish instincts will more fundamentally control him
  - His fundamental self is his **primitive, violent** self
- **Marcus**
  - **[+]** Altruistic at times **[-]** but instincts of envy and lust for money get the better of him
  - **Irrationally** and **self-destructively** pursues Mac into the heart of Death Valley
  - He irrationally ignores the sheriff's advice and **instinctively** pursues Mac
- **Trina**
  - **[+]** A loving wife at times **[-]** but larger (pathological) forces of miserliness ultimately control her  
    `Intertitle: “a veritable mental disease”`

##### [2] Governed by Heredity

- McTeague’s father (added by Stroheim) and how McTeague cannot escape from qualities genetically transmitted by his father
- McTeague cannot escape inheriting his father’s weaknesses and degeneracy  
  ```
  Intertitle: “Below the fine fabric bred of his mother ran the foul stream of hereditary evil… The taint of generations given through his father…”
  ```
- When McTeague succumbs to alcohol, we observe the ghost of his father exerting its influence on the present

##### [3] Limited by Environment

- Animals are often confined to their own environment while man can shape the environment to his will
- In the film though, characters are instead **confined, trapped or even destroyed by their physical environment**
- These characters are **animal-like**, have a weak relation to their environment
  - **Death Valley**
  - **Mac and Trina's living space**:  
    Trina’s greed keeps them living in the cramped space above the dentist’s office despite them being able to afford a house of their own

##### [4] Larger forces

- Literal or symbolic/abstract 
    ```
    Intertitle: "...mysterious instincts, as ungovernable as the winds of heaven, were knitting their lives together"

    -  McTeague and Trina’s lives as controlled by larger forces
    ```
  - **Giant hand** grasping the 2 struggling figures
  - **Funeral procession**
    - In the background while the wedding is taking place in the foreground
    - Juxtaposition that the marriage will result in the death of the characters
    - The wedding is not a wedding, but a funeral
  - **Lottery official**
    - **Literal force**: figure of fate bestowing fortune
    - **Abstract force**: A fortune that turns out to be fate working destructively in Trina's marriage and life
  - Some of these forces are “symbolic”

- **Determinism** in Naturalist philosophy: characters’ lives are determined by given forces
- Could Mac, Marcus or Trina have behaved differently to forestall the tragedy that their lives became?  
  If yes, this would detract from the film’s strong sense of determinism

## C. Film-making in Greed

### C1. Diegesis

> Refers to the world of the film’s story

- **Diegetic element**: Includes events that are presumed to have occurred but are not shown on screen  
  ```
  E.g. Marcus’ act of writing to the dental authorities
  ```
- **Nondiegetic element**: Not part of the film's world  
  ```
  E.g. Most film scores
  ```

Are the **surreal shots of the hands** diegetic or nondiegetic?

- **Diagetic**: They are part of the dreams/ they are Trina's hands
- **Nondiagetic**: They are abstract/symbolic

### C2. Mise-en-scene

> All the objects and other elements placed in front of the camera to be photographed

- Includes props, setting, costumes, make-up, lighting, figure behavior  
  ```
  E.g. Marcus' figure behavior when he crawls up to Mac in Death Valley
  - Represents his regression into primal animalistic nature
  ```
- Includes **composition** of elements of mise-en-scene
  - Stroheim’s penchant for compositions in depth (using deep space settings)  
  - Use of Multiplane Composition

##### Multiplane composition
> Composition using foreground, middle ground and background

```
E.g. 
Mac and Marcus at Cliff House
Wedding/Funeral scene
```

#### C2-i. Use of Mise-en-scene to reflect Naturalism

The meaning and impact of Greed is achieved through the use of mise-en-scene.

- Emphasis on authenticity
- Painstakingly detailed, film rewards a viewer who is attentive to mise-en-scene details

##### Excerpt 1: Mac returns home after losing his job at the factory

1. **Giant Tooth**
   - Once displayed proudly outside Mac’s dental clinic
   - Now relegated to a table in the apartment

2. **Bird Cage reflected in Mirror**
   - Symbolic commentary on the marriage, became like a cage for the couple
   - **Irony**:
     - Bird cage was a wedding gift
     - Current placement is a counterpoint to the current state of marriage
     - Callback to happier times

3. **Wedding photo placed between the couple in frame**
   - Used to sit in grandly furnished studio, now sits in a squalid place (the apartment)
   - Trying to hold the marriage together while it’s falling apart

##### Excerpt 2: Mac and Trina go on a date

1. **Deep space setting**
   - Background far away, sense of a vast space
   - Foregrounds characters are contained within an environment inhospitable to them
   - Storm forces them out of the open space into a confined shelter space

2. **Dead rat**, a death motif
3. **Mac's accordion**
   - Artistic, musical positive side to him

4. **Beer bottle ad** in shelter
   - Foreshadows Mac’s alcoholism

5. **End of scene**
   - Mac triumphant
   - However, next shot shows him going towards the train with cage bar-like pillars in the foreground

### C3. Props and costumes

> Prop: any object that plays a part in the dramatic action  
```
E.g. Truck in Landscape in the Mist
```

- Provides commentary on the action
- At times, an ironic counterpoint to the action
- Foreshadows what is to come

#### Examples

- Birdcage and the bird
- Christmas decorations
- Toy houses
- Mousetrap (in the restored version only)
- Dead rat
- Beer advertisement
- Trina’s wedding gown
- Costume and figure behaviour

Stroheim tends to use props ironically  
```
E.g. Scene where Mac murders Trina
- Background: cheerful Christmas decor
- Foreground: Husband returning to terrorize his wife
```

Example of Stroheim's use of costume:  
```
E.g. Trina's wedding gown makes her look ghostly -> instance of the death motif
```

### C4. Motifs

> an element in a film that is repeated in a significant way (not confined to props)

```
E.g. An abstract visual motif, like the forward, penetrating camera movement in Citizen Kane
E.g. Musical motifs
```

- A prop becomes a motif if it is repeated in the film  
  ```
  E.g. The wedding photograph and the birdcage become motifs through repetition.
  ```
- Creates patterns within the film
  - Pattern of parallels or pattern of contrast
  - Functions as a commentary on the action

#### Motifs in Greed

1. **Death images**
   - Dead rat, the funeral hearse, the coffin, the skull of goats, the carcasses of animals, even Trina’s wedding gown, Death Valley
   - Reminds us of the doom that awaits the characters, even during a happy occasion like the wedding

2. **Hands**
   - Used for irony

3. **The bird**

### C5. Setting

1. Rural, Urban then back to Rural (Death Valley)
2. McTeague and Trina’s home
   - Changes in their home situation parallel their deterioration
   - Reinforces the idea of humans in a degraded state

#### C5-i. Deep Space

> An arrangement of mise-en-scene so that there is a considerable distance between the plane closest to the camera and the one farthest away. Any or all of these planes may be in focus.  

```
E.g. Death Valley
```

Often used with multiplane composition.  
```
E.g. Mac and Marcus, cliff house scene
```

#### C5-ii. Shallow Space

Opposite of Deep Space.
