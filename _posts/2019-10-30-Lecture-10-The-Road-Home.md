## A. Introduction

> *The Road Home* is a film that seeks to address contemporary China with a message:
>
> An appeal to present-day China to return to the deeper values and ideals that are part of China’s past

Reinforced by use of [**cinematography**](#c1-cinematography)

### A1. Zhang Yimou

Trademarks:
1. A strong female protagonist who goes against social prohibitions
2. The use of **colour**, especially, vibrant colours to signify **passion and emotion**

Theory:
1. Films should be “**very common and popular**”
    - To address vast Chinese nation

2. Films should **address the emotions and the senses**
    - Subject matter should be simple so that the **emotions can be clearly foregrounded**

---

## B. Themes in The Road Home

### B1. Critique of Modern China

- Modern Chinese society has **lost its direction**
- The market economy dominates everything and Chinese people have become ultra-materialistic
- Society and the arts have become **boring and devitalized**, lacking in passion and vitality
- “We want to remain true to ourselves but how should we do that?”

## C. Film-making in The Road Home

### C1. Cinematography

> Zhang uses the senses and emotions to appeal to and inspire the viewer
> 
> Main idea: The past has a vitality that today’s materialistic China lacks


#### C1-i. Contemporary scenes

Black and White:
  - Helps to reinforce Zhang Yimou’s negative perception of contemporary, capitalist China
  - Drab, lacking in vitality

```
E.g. Schoolhouse scene at the end

- Red banner, in black and white, is barely noticeable -> reinforces how drab and devitalized modern day China has become

```

#### C1-ii. Past scenes

In color

```
E.g.

- Red banner is vibrant and vivid in color
- Shot of Zhao Di in red sweater contrasts against the gray landscape and road
```

- Representing **passion and tenacity** needed to travel the road
- The vibrant colours counter the emotional repression of the Chinese people
- **“Red”** reflects freedom and exuberance as well as **primal desires and aspirations**, denied by both Confucianism and Communism.
```
E.g. Red sweater
```

### C2. Mise-en-scene and Props

> Things/physical objects are linked to materialism, the pursuit of things that deaden the human spirit

#### C2-i. Different historical eras

> Used to indicate China’s different historical eras, in particular its different political and economic systems

##### Posters of *Titanic* (1997)

> An icon of American popular culture and **global capitalism**

- How China is plugged into the global free-market economy
- China as being under 2 different regimes at different times
  - State control versus pressures of global market economy
  - In different eras, subject ti communist propoganda OR "cultural indoctrination" of US mass culture


##### Posters of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)

- How China is under the Communist state with a centrally planned economy

#### C2-ii. Different values

(From the current shallow materialistic values)

##### Zhao Di's bowl

- Repaired slowly
- Suggests the difference between a bowl that is **“personalized”** and one that is **mass produced** in a market economy
- The skill of repairing the bowl: an art that is vanishing in present-day China

##### Zhao Di's hairpin, loom

- Where things do not deaden the person, but reflect the **passion, vitality and strength** of characters

### C3. Motifs

#### C3-i. The Road

- Film opens and closes with images of The Road

```
E.g. Contrast

Opening shot: vehicle travelling down road, contemporary times
Closing shot: Zhao Di running down the road
```

- 2 Levels:
    1. A **course of hardship** for individuals, yet it allows individuals to display their **character qualities**
        - Perseverance, tenacity, devotion, passion
    2. Symbolic of the course that the Chinese nation ought to take
        - Relates its past strengths and values more meaningfully with its present
        ```
        E.g. Connects city to the village
        ```

#### C3-ii. Schoolhouse

- The schoolhouse is built by the people.
- We see the schoolhouse at the start and at the end, it will be re-built
- **A symbol for China**
