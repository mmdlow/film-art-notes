## A. His Girl Friday

### A1. Themes

- Comic satire of the worlds of journalism and politics
- Uses comedy to perform social critique
  ```
  "It all happened in the ‘dark ages’ of the newspaper game—when to a reporter ‘getting that story’ justified anything short of murder." - Opening Titles
  ```
- Shows how the political world is a parallel to the journalistic world

#### A1-i. Criticisms of Journalists

The journalists of His Girl Friday are:

- Unscrupulous and lacking in morals
- Lacking in compassion
- Corrupt

```
E.g. Hildy bribes a policeman to get access to Earl Williams
```

#### A1-ii. Criticisms of Politicians

The politicians of His Girl Friday are similary characterized by:

- Unscrupulousness
- Expediency
- Corruption

```
E.g.
The mayor is corrupt and capable of bribery
Again, for the mayor, Earl Williams is just a political issue linked to the elections:
    -> The mayor needs to hang Earl Williams to be re-elected
    -> Earl Williams shot a black policeman
    -> The mayor depends on the black vote.
```

### A2. Comedy in His Girl Friday

Types of comedy used:

- Verbal wit and humor
- Use of contrast
- Physical comedy
- Use of repetition

#### A2-i. Verbal Comedy

Includes:

- Witty verbal repartee
- Verbal insults
- Verbal miscomprehension

Shows contrast between the worldly-wise characters and the more naïve, innocent characters

```
E.g. The mayor versus Pettibone
Pettibone doesn’t even know he’s being bribed, while bribery is second nature to the mayor
```

### A3. Sound in His Girl Friday

- Uses **Overlapping Dialogue**
- Provides film with a sense of speed

```
Another e.g: Citizen Kane, boarding house scene
```

## B. Classical Hollywood Cinema

### B1. Narrative Form

> CHC films:
>
> 1. are [Character-centered](#b1-i-character-centered-narrative)
> 2. have [Well-defined Character Traits](#b1-ii-well-defined-character-traits)
> 3. are [Character-driven](#b1-iii-character-driven-narrative)
> 4. have a [Strong Sense of Narrative Closure](#b1-iv-strong-sense-of-narrative-closure)

#### B1-i. Character-centered Narrative

- Focus is on individuals
- Characters who are **highly individualized**

```
E.g. His Girl Friday

Walter: quick-thinking, scheming
Hildy:  equally fast on her feet, able to engage in verbal sparring with Walter
Bruce:  sincere, trusting, naïve
```

#### B1-ii. Well-defined Character Traits

- Characters are thus **easily knowable**
- Examples of non-character-centered films:
  - October: Ten Days That Shook the World (_dir. Sergei Eisenstein, 1927_)
  - The Color of Pomegranates (_dir. Sergei Paradjanov, 1969_)

#### B1-iii. Character-driven Narrative

- Characters are usually **active agents who drive the narrative forward**
- They have clear motivations, goals and desires that propel the narrative

```
E.g. His Girl Friday

Walter’s goal is to win back Hildy
Hildy’s goal is to leave journalism and marry Bruce to become a “real woman”
```

#### B1-iv. Strong Sense of Narrative Closure

All outstanding issues are resolved by the end of the film

### B2. Cinematic Style

Top priority is to focus on individual characters and the dramatic action they generate

> **Continuity System**
>
> Cinematic techniques are used to present the characters and dramatic action in **as clear and uninterrupted** a way as possible

#### B2-i. Continuity Editing

- Typical CHC film comprises 600-800 shots
- In **Continuity Editing**, these shots produce a narrative where the chain of events flows smoothly and clearly
- Presents the characters and action as clearly as possible
- Enables the narrative (shot after shot) to flow with as little interruption as possible
  - Facilitates the powerful illusion of the story being a "**natural event**" without anyone putting it together
  - Spatial and temporal structures in the narrative are coherent
- Involves the **seamless/invisible** coordination of cinematography, mise-en-scene and editing
  - Conceals technique being used

5 Aspects of Continuity Editing:

1. [Establishing Shot](#establishing-shot)
2. [180-degree Rule](#180-degree-rule)
3. [Shot/Reverse Shot](#shotreverse-shot)
4. [Eyeline Match](#eyeline-match)
5. [Match on Action](#match-on-action)

##### Establishing Shot

> Establishes the overall space of a scene

- Shot usually from a distant framing, that shows the overall space of a scene
- Shows clearly the spatial relation between the characters
- Usually occurs close to the beginning of the scene
- After the establishing shot, one needs to **break down the space of the scene into parts** (while maintaining continuity)

##### 180-degree Rule

> When directors break down the space of a scene, shots will be taken from **only one side of the 180 degree line**

- Ensures consistent **screen direction**

> **Screen Direction:** The left-right relationship in a scene

##### Shot/Reverse Shot

- Also an example of breaking down the scene space
- Two or more shots edited together of **alternate characters**, typically in a conversation scene
- Allows close views of characters as they engage with one another
  - E.g. Facial expressions
- Typically uses **Over the shoulder** filming

##### Eyeline Match

> A cut where the 1st shot shows a person looking off in one direction and the 2nd shot what she sees.

- Helps reinforce continuity
- 180 degree rule must be obeyed first.

##### Match on Action

> A cut that occurs in the midst of an action

- Viewer is so focused on action that he does not notice the cut
- Reinforces the "**invisible**" aspect of continuity editing

```
E.g. His Girl Friday, Office scene at the beginning

When Hildy flings her bag at Walter, it cuts on the action to a wider shot
```
